## About the 1950Labs Icon Set:
In 1950Labs we started some time ago to create and collect different icons that we believe are necessary in the software we develop, that's how we created the 1950Labs icon set. In this free downloadable icon set we can find in SVG and PNG icons that are necessary in any software.
